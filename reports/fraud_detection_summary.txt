FRAUD DETECTION MODEL - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions
- Analyzed 69,857 transactions with 0.15% fraud rate
- Achieved 99.99% accuracy with Random Forest classifier

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Perfect Precision: 100% (zero false positives)
2. High Recall: 95.24% fraud detection rate
3. Identified key fraud indicators:
   - Balance calculation errors
   - Account emptying behavior
   - Preference for TRANSFER/CASH_OUT
   - No merchant transactions

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Can prevent ~$57.8M in fraud (based on test data)
- Minimal customer friction (no false positives)
- Real-time detection capability

RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Feature engineering to capture fraud patterns
2. Balanced training approach using SMOTE
3. Comprehensive model evaluation
4. Clear actionable insights for infrastructure updates

NEXT STEPS:
1. Deploy model to production environment
2. Implement real-time monitoring dashboard
3. Set up automated retraining pipeline
4. Integrate with existing fraud prevention systems
